Welcome to the London Bikecam Guide :wave:

This site is intended to serve as a comprehensive guide for anyone who wants to use a video camera while cycling in Greater London.

If you are considering using a camera while cycling, start by thinking about [why you might want to run a camera]({% link _docs/why-run-a-camera.md %}), or perhaps jump straight to [choosing a camera]({% link _docs/choosing-a-camera.md %}) if you're sure you want to use one.

On the other hand, if you already have a camera you may want to learn [how to use it](), [how to mount it](), and [what to do in an incident]().

Once you have some footage from your camera, you'll want to [review your footage](), [make clips](), and maybe [submit reports to the Met]().
If you make reports, you're also likely to get [responses from the Met]() and if you're (un)lucky you may even be [asked to attend court]().
